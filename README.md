### Motivation
Regis will be my 2nd attempt at a more involved project. The idea behind Regis is to allow learners to practice one of the hardest skills in language learning; listening comprehension. It's an app that will primarily allow users to listen to an audio and transcribe what they hear. The app will then compare the user's transcription to the actual transcription and give them a score based on how accurate they were. The app will also have a social aspect to it where users can follow other users and see their progress, and compete on a weekly leaderboard. I do have more ideas for the app but I'll keep it at that for now.

### Tech Stack

- SvelteKit (Frontend)
- ASP.NET Minimal API (Backend)
- MongoDB (Database)
- Docker (Containerization)
